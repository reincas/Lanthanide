# Lanthanide 0.9.5

This is a Python 3 package to calculate the energy levels of multi-electron systems
populating the 4f configuration, which means the lanthanide or rare-earth ions from
Ce<sup>3+</sup> (4f<sup>1</sup>) to Yb<sup>3+</sup> (4f<sup>13</sup>). The
calculation is based on Racahs single electron unit tensor operators as developed
in my PhD thesis [1]. You find a copy of the [thesis](docs/Dissertation.pdf) and
[corrections](docs/errata5.pdf) in the folder `docs`.

The matrix elements are calculated in the space of determinantal product
states and then transformed to the SLJM space using the chain of operators:

$$ \mathbf{S}^2 \to \mathbf{G}(R_7) \to \mathbf{G}(G_2)
\to \mathbf{L}^2 \to \mathbf{J}^2 \to \mathrm{J}_z $$

All six perturbation Hamiltonians with a total of 19 radial integrals known from the literature are used
to calculate the energy levels of a given Lathanide ion.
In the order of their relative magnitude they are:

1. Coulomb interaction between the electrons (1st order):
   $\mathbf{H}_1 = F^2 \mathbf{f}_2 + F^4 \mathbf{f}_4 + F^6 \mathbf{f}_6$,
   with the radial integrals $F^2$, $F^4$, and $F^6$
   and the respective angular two-electron operators $\mathbf{f}_2$, $\mathbf{f}_4$, and $\mathbf{f}_6$.
   The Lanthanide package uses the keys `"H1/2"`, `"H1/4"`, and `"H1/6"` for radial parameters (integrals)
   and angular matrices (operators).
2. Magnetic spin-orbit interaction of each electron (1st order):
   $\mathbf{H}_2 = \zeta \mathbf{z}$,
   with the radial integral $\zeta$ and the angular one-electron operator $\mathbf{z}$.
   The Lanthanide package uses the key `"H2"` for the radial parameter and the angular matrix.
3. Coulomb inter-configuration interactions (2nd order):
   $\mathbf{H}_3 = \alpha \mathbf{L}^2 + \beta \mathbf{G}(G_2) + \gamma \mathbf{G}(R_7)$,
   with the radial integrals $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$.
   The respective effective angular two-electron operators $\mathbf{L}^2$, $\mathbf{G}(G_2)$, and $\mathbf{G}(R_7)$
   are the squared operator of the total orbital angular momentum and
   the Casimir operators of the symmetry groups $R_7$ and $G_2$.
   The Lanthanide package uses the keys `"H3/0"`, `"H3/1"`, and `"H3/2"` for radial parameters and angular matrices.
4. More Coulomb inter-configuration interactions (2nd order):
   $\mathbf{H}_4 = \sum_c T^c \mathbf{t}_c$, with $c = 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8$.
   The radial integrals are $T^c$ and the respective effective angular three-electron operators
   $\mathbf{t}_c$.
   The Lanthanide package uses the keys `"H4/2"`, `"H4/3"`, `"H4/4"`, `"H4/6"`, `"H4/7"`, and `"H4/8"` for
   radial parameters and angular matrices.
5. Magnetic interactions of the spin of one electron with the spin (ss) or the orbital angular momentum (soo)
   of another electron (1st order):
   $\mathbf{H}_5 = M^0 \mathbf{m}_0 + M^2 \mathbf{m}_2 + M^4 \mathbf{m}_4$,
   with the Marvin integrals $M^0$, $M^2$, and $M^4$ and the respective angular two-electron operators
   $\mathbf{m}_0$, $\mathbf{m}_2$, and $\mathbf{m}_4$.
   The Lanthanide package uses the keys `"H5/0"`, `"H5/2"`, and `"H5/4"` for radial parameters and angular matrices.
6. Magnetic inter-configuration spin-orbit interactions (2nd order):
   $\mathbf{H}_6 = P^2 \mathbf{p}_2 + P^4 \mathbf{p}_4 + P^6 \mathbf{p}_6$,
   with the radial integrals $P^2$, $P^4$, and $P^6$ and the respective angular two-electron operators
   $\mathbf{p}_2$, $\mathbf{p}_4$, and $\mathbf{p}_6$.
   The Lanthanide package uses the keys `"H6/2"`, `"H6/4"`, and `"H6/6"` for radial parameters and angular matrices.

The first order perturbations are interactions inside the 4f configuration, while second order perturbations
take interactions with all other configurations into account. They are treated by effective operators
mathematically operating inside the 4f configuration.

## Installation

**Note**: _This package is work-in-progress now.
Everything is available but has not settled to its final shape yet.
Expect interfaces to be changed._

To build and install the package, download the files from GitHub and run the command

```
python -m pip install .
```

## Lanthanide class

You always start using the Lanthanide package by importing the most important symbols:

```
from lanthanide import Lanthanide, Coupling
```

A dictionary of radial radial parameters (integrals) looks like this:

```
radial = { "base": 327.39, "H1/2": 68576.05, "H1/4": 49972.76, "H1/6": 32415.29, "H2": 728.18,
    "H3/0": 16.99, "H3/1": -417.98, "H3/2": 1371, "H5fix": 0.19, "H6fix": 1.67 }
```

where `"base"` fixes the energy of the ground state and the special parameters `"H5fix"` and `"H6fix"` are
abbreviations for the common choices $M^2 = 0.56 M^0$, $M^4 = 0.38 M^0$ and $P^4 = 0.75 P^2$, $P^6 = 0.50 P^2$.
The unit of the parameters is that of an energy.
The code does not depend on your choice of the unit, but it is advisable to stay with the literature standard,
which means using wavenumbers in cm<sup>-1</sup>.
As the inverse of radiation wavelengths in vacuum

$$
k = \frac{1}{\lambda}
$$

wavenumbers are proportional to the photon energy of the radiation:

$$
E = h c k
$$

You may choose operation in either the SLJ or the SLJM space. The latter is used to calculate the Stark splitting
and slows down the calculations significantly, see the section on crystal fields below. In SLJ coupling the quantum
number J of the total angular momentum is a good quantum number and the magnetic quantum number M of the total
angular momentum does not matter. Select SLJ coupling and initialize the Lanthanide ion by giving the number of
4f electrons in the range from 1 to 13:

```
coupling = Coupling.SLJ
ion = Lanthanide(2, coupling, radial)
print(ion)
```

If not specified, the default coupling is SLJ and the default radial parameters are those given by Carnall
for LaF<sub>3</sub>.

The Lanthanide object builds the matrix of the total perturbation Hamiltonian and diagonalises it, which results
in the energy level and the SLJ composition of each state in intermediate coupling.
The process is accelerated by diagonalising the much smaller J sub-spaces individually.
Each state in intermediate coupling is a mixture of different SLJ states with the same total angular momentum J.
You can access all state objects in the list `Lanthanide.intermediate.states` with the ground state in first position.
This code delivers energy, weight factors and the respective SLJ components of the first excited state:

```
state = ion.intermediate.states[1]
print(state.energy, state.weights, state.states)
```

For each state object there is a long string representation, which you can access by `str(state)` or
`state.long(min_weight=0.0)` and a short version by `state.short()`.
The parameter `min_weight` is useful for ions with a large number of states.
It gives the minimum weight of a SLJ state to appear in the list.
This allows to show the most important components only.
A shortcut to the list of energies of all states is the attribute `ion.energies`.
The method `ion.str_levels(min_weight=0.0)` provides a convenient way to display the energy level spectrum
on a terminal:

```
for line in ion.str_levels(0.05):
    print(line)
```

The calculation of a new energy level spectrum can be triggered at any time by providing a new set of
radial parameters:

```
from lanthanide import RADIAL
ion.set_radial(RADIAL["Pr3+/ZBLAN"])
```

## Crystal field splitting

The calculation of a full lanthanide spectrum including the Stark splitting is supported by the Lanthanide package and
activated by selecting `Coupling.SLJM`:

```
ion = Lanthanide(2, Coupling.SLJM, radial)
```

The `Lanthanide` object now supports real or complex crystal field parameters `Hcf/{k},{q}` with the rank $k=2,4,6$
and $q=0\ldots k$ besides the usual radial parameters in the `radial` dictionary. The set of none-zero parameters
is determined by the site symmetry of the lanthanide ion. Note that crystal field interactions release the J degeneracy
of the free ion hamiltonian. Diagonalisation of the full hamiltonian including crystal field matrices takes place in
the full state space and is thus much slower than in SLJ coupling. States in intermediate SLJM coupling are linear
combinations of all SLJM states, although usually a small number of dominant SLJM states determines the character
of an intermediate state.

## Radiative transitions

For radiative transitions inside the 4f configuration of Lanthanides only electric and magnetic
dipole moments are relevant.
The calculation of the respective transition strengths according to the Judd-Ofelt theory is based on
the reduced matrix elements
$\langle J_j\parallel \mathbf{U}^{(2)}\parallel J_i \rangle$,
$\langle J_j\parallel \mathbf{U}^{(4)}\parallel J_i \rangle$, and
$\langle J_j\parallel \mathbf{U}^{(6)}\parallel J_i \rangle$ for electric and
$\frac{1}{\hbar} \langle J_j\parallel \mathbf{L} + g_s \mathbf{S}\parallel J_i \rangle$
for magnetic dipole transitions.
The method `Lanthanide.line_reduced()` delivers a `Reduced` object, which contains all four squared reduced matrices
as attributes `U2`, `U4`, `U6`, and `LS` as required for the calculation of transition strengths.
The matrix element for a transition from an initial state `i` to a final state `j` is addressed by `array[j,i]`.
This code shows the squared elements
$|\langle J_j\parallel \mathbf{U}^{(4)}\parallel J_0 \rangle|^2$ for transitions from the ground state
to all excited states:

```
reduced = ion.line_reduced()
print(reduced.U4[1:, 0])
```

There is no universally accepted definition of the line strength of a transition. For electric dipole transitions,
the Lanthanide package uses the definition

$$
S_{ed} = \frac{1}{3(2J_i+1)} \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum\limits_{\lambda=2,4,6}
\Omega_\lambda |\langle J_j\parallel \mathbf{U}^{(\lambda)}\parallel J_i\rangle|^2
$$

with the Judd-Ofelt parameters $\Omega_2$, $\Omega_4$, and $\Omega_6$. For magnetic dipole transitions we use

$$
S_{md} = \frac{1}{3(2J_i+1)} \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{\beta_m^2}{c^2 \hbar^2}
|\langle J_j\parallel \mathbf{L}+g_s\mathbf{S}\parallel J_i\rangle|^2
$$

with the Bohr magneton $\beta_m = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$.
The physical unit of these line strength values is Jm<sup>3</sup>.
For a given set of Judd-Ofelt parameters in pm<sup>2</sup> you can also get the radiative line strength of
each transition using the method `line_strengths()`:

```
judd_ofelt = { "JO/2": 1.981, "JO/4": 4.645, "JO/6": 6.972 }
strength = ion.line_strengths(judd_ofelt)
print(strength.Sed[1:, 0])
print(strength.Smd[1:, 0])
```

## Spectroscopic parameters

The line strengths are typically used to calculate the dimensionless oscillator strength of a transition $i\to j$
in absorption or emission:

$$
f_{ij} = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0}{e^2} \frac{4 \pi m_e c k_{ij}}{\hbar}
\[\chi^\prime_{ed}S_{ed} + \chi^\prime_{md}S_{md}\]
$$

with the energy level difference $k_{ij}=|k_i-k_j|$ (in wavenumbers) and the local field correction factors

$$
\chi^\prime_{ed} = \frac{(n^2+2)^2}{9n} \qquad \chi^\prime_{md} = n
$$

Another useful quantity is the spontaneous radiative emission rate (in s<sup>-1</sup>) of a transition:

$$
A_{ij} = \frac{32 \pi^3 k_{ij}^3}{\hbar}
\[\chi_{ed}S_{ed} + \chi_{md}S_{md}\]
$$

with the local field correction factors

$$
\chi_{ed} = \frac{n(n^2+2)^2}{9} \qquad \chi_{md} = n^3
$$

Please be aware that due to dispersion the refractive index $n(k_{ij})$ in general is a function of the
wavenumber $k_{ij}$ of the transition.

## Caching

Matrix elements of angular tensors are physical constants for a given electron configuration.
Therefore, the Lanthanide package stores them after their first calculation in the sub-directory

```
.../Lib/site-packages/lathanide/vaults
```

of the package installation folder.
The calculation can be very time consuming especially for configurations with 4-10 electrons.
You should therefore consider running the the function `create_all()`:

```
from lanthanide import create_all
create_all()
```

It will trigger the calculation of all perturbation hamiltonians and reduced transition matrix elements
for all lanthanide ions.
Expect it to run for more than 24 hours on a typical office PC.
It will generate about 9 GB of data in the folder `vaults`.
There is one cache file for each of the 13 lanthanide configurations.

It is recommended to close the cache file gracefully by calling `Lanthanide.close()` when the work on
one configuration is finished:

```
ion = Lanthanide(2)
print(ion)
energies = ion.energies
reduced = ion.reduced()
ion.close()
```

As an alternative, the Lanthanide class also supports the context management protocol.
You can thus use it to start a `with` block.
The cache file will be closed automatically when the program leaves the block and no manual closing is required:

```
with Lanthanide(2) as ion:
    print(ion)
    energies = ion.energies
    reduced = ion.reduced()
```

The Lanthanide package uses an additional cache for perturbation hamiltonians.
To accelerate energy level fits of radial parameters,
these matrices are kept in the memory after their first retrival from the cache file.
There is also a cache for the reduced transition matrix elements.
Consecutive calls of `Lanthanide.reduced()` will deliver the same object until a new set of radial parameters
is applied via `Lanthanide.set_radial()`.
