# Internals of the Lanthanide package

Here you find the documentation of some classes and functions, which are not necessary for using the Lanthanide package,
but might be interesting, if you want to dig deeper. You can import each of them from `lanthanide`.

## HalfInt class

The value of quantum numbers of angular momenta in quantum mechanics in general may be integer or half-integer. The
class `HalfInt` is a lean solution for the representation of half-integer values. To create a `HalfInt` object, provide
its numerator as a parameter. The class supports basic mathematical operations involving other `HalfInt` of `int`
objects. Results with even numerator are converted into `Ã¬nt` objects:

```
from lanthanide import HalfInt

print(HalfInt(1) + 2 == HalfInt(5))
print(4 * HalfInt(3) == 6)
print(5 * HalfInt(1) == HalfInt(5))
print(HalfInt(5) >= 1)
print(HalfInt(1) - HalfInt(5) == -2)
print(HalfInt(3) - HalfInt(2) == HalfInt(1))
print(HalfInt(-3).numerator == -3)
```

The class has one attribute `numerator`:

```
print(HalfInt(-3).numerator == -3)
```

## Wigner symbols

The Lanthanide package uses Wigner 3-j symbols extensively to calculate matrix elements of tensor operators. To get the
value of a 3-j symbol

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
j_1 & j_2 & j_3 \\
m_1 & m_2 & m_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

you use the function `wigner3j(j1, j2, j3, m1, m2, m3)`. The arguments may be either `int` or `HalfInt` objects:

```
from lanthanide import wigner3j
factor = wigner3j(2, HalfInt(3), HalfInt(3), 0, -HalfInt(1), HalfInt(1))
```

The Lanthanide package does not require Wigner 6-j symbols internally, because it builds tensor matrices in the space of
determinantal product states. However, if you want to process the matrices in higher-order coupling, you might be
interested in Wigner 6-j symbols

$$
\begin{Bmatrix}
j_1 & j_2 & j_3 \\
l_1 & l_2 & l_3
\end{Bmatrix}
$$

as well. For that purpose, the package provides the function `wigner6j(j1, j2, j3, l1, l2, l3)`. The arguments may be
either `int` or `HalfInt` objects again:

```
from lanthanide import wigner6j
factor = wigner6j(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2)
```

The calculation of Wigner symbols can be costly. Therefore, the Lanthanide package is using runtime caching for calls of
the functions `wigner3j` and `wigner6j`. Subsequent function calls with the same parameters take their result from the
cache.

## SingleElements class

The class `SingleElements` supports you with the calculation of matrices of your own one-, two- or three-electron
tensor operators in the determinantal product space. It exploits the fact that these matrices are necessarily
sparse because all matrix elements between states which differ in more electrons than the respective tensor operator
is acting on, must be zero.

The `SingleElements` object for the current configuration is available in the attribute `single` of a `Lanthanide`
object:

```
with Lanthanide(2) as ion:
    single = ion.single
```
