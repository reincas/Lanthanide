#
# This module provides an interface supporting the calculation of the
# matrices of tensor operators in the determinantal product space of a
# given electron configuration. It exploits the fact that these matrices
# are necessarily sparse because all matrix elements between states which
# differ in more electrons than the respective tensor operator is acting
# on, must be zero.
#
# The data structure of the interface contains a list of potential
# non-zero matrix elements and a list of binary bra-ket keys for the
# evaluation of one-, two, or three-electron elementary tensor operators.
# Conversion of electron tuples to binary keys reduces the disk space
# significantly and increases the calculation speed.
#
# No quantum numbers are used in this module. Electrons are
# characterised by their index into a list of indistinguishable
# electrons in standard order. In case of the 4f electron configurations
# of the lanthanides this means that the electron index my range
# from 0-13.
